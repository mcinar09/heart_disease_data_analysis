### Introduction



In this project, we are analyzing heart disease data obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository to find patterns and groups in patient information. We're using several methods to do this:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): First, we use KNN, a method that helps us classify patients based on their data. It looks at similar cases in the data and uses them to classify each patient.

K-Means Clustering: Next, we use k-means clustering. This method groups patients into clusters where patients in each cluster are similar to each other. It helps us see if there are common patterns among groups of patients.

Visualization of Clusters by PCA: To visualize the clusters formed by K-means, we employ Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By reducing the dimensionality of the dataset to its first two principal components (PC1 and PC2), we create a two-dimensional representation that captures the majority of the variance within the data. This visualization aids in interpreting the clustering results, offering a clear view of the patient groups in a reduced-dimensional space.

Hierarchical Clustering: Finally, we use hierarchical clustering. This method also groups patients but in a way that shows us a hierarchy, from very broad groups down to more specific ones.

Through this analysis, we aim to provide insightful categorizations of patients based on their heart disease data, offering a potential pathway for personalized medicine and targeted healthcare interventions. This project not only underscores the power of machine learning in healthcare analytics but also highlights the importance of methodical data exploration in deriving meaningful conclusions from complex medical datasets.
